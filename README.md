## üåç IMF GDP ETL Project


This project involves creating an automated script to extract, transform, and load (ETL) GDP data of all countries as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The script will be used by an international firm looking to expand its business across different countries. The data will be updated twice a year based on IMF's releases.

## What Does This Do?
- Extract: Fetch GDP data for all countries from the IMF website.
- Transform: Clean and round the GDP values to 2 decimal places.
- Load: Save the data to a JSON file and a SQLite database.
- Query: Show off by querying countries with GDPs over 100 billion USD.
- Log: Keep track of everything in a log file.
